<p>SAMIZDAT is a free software initiative from me, <a href="https://github.com/tokahuke">a guy you just met in the Internet</a> and some more helpful folks you have not met yet, but are as important. I am of course talking about the contributors to the project. Do you want to join the cause? Anyone is welcome, as long as you keep the conversation civil. Go to the <a href="https://github.com/tokahuke/samizdat">project page on GitHub</a> and have a look around. There is plenty to be done!
</p>

<p>No idea how to code? No problem! You can also <a href="~/donate">donate some crypto</a> to be used in the project. After all, we do 
have a 
small server which we need to keep running to bootstrap to project and with your support we can lure developers to work for the project with the sweet scent of cash.
</p> 

<h2 class="text-monospace font-weight-bold pt-2">User privacy</h2>

<p>No, we have no data on anything. We track no one, there is no database on anything, no accounts, no IPs, no cookies, no timestamps. And thank God! Those things are a pain to maintain and cost money. If you have a warrant, we will be glad to take a look. However, you are most likely to come out empty-handed.
</p>

<p>We just make free software for anyone to use, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html">without any warranty</a>.
