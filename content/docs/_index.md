# The SAMIZDAT Documentation

In these troubling times, some people might find it hard to publish their
content to the web. Samizdat is a P2P network for sharing and publishing
content without the need of a centralized server, most of which are run by
_them_. Self-publish your content today with Samizdat!

## Introduction

Welcome to the SAMIZDAT documentation, where we will get you up to speed
with surfing this extension of the Web as well as developing for it. If you
just want to have a quick look to learn how to use SAMIZDAT in your day-to-day
life, [getting started](docs/getting-started) is all that you will ever need.
However, if you wish to create, publish and manage your own content in the
network (e.g, create a personal blog), please keep reasing further about
[developing with SAMIZDAT](/docs/developing-with-samizdat). Finally, if you
want to delve deeper on the nitty-gritty details of how SAMZIDAT works, the
section on [architecture](/docs/architecture) is for you.

Enjoy!

## On the POC status

This is still a proof of concept (POC) implementation. So three caveats are in
place:

1. Don't rely on the availability of the network or of your content; have
   alternatives in place.
2. Expect frequent breaking changes.
3. Expect vulnerabilities. Do not use the network for sensitive content yet.

However, don't let these hard words dissuade you from using SAMIZDAT. Just
keep your Git repository up-to-date and upgrade your SAMIZDAT version
frequently.
