# Developing with SAMIZDAT

So, you want to create your own site (or webapp) running on SAMIZDAT? Welcome aboard! Overall, developing for SAMIZDAT is very similar to developing a standard webapp. If your pipeline is able to create a folder in your computer with all the compiled assets, as most pipelines are, you are few commands away from deployment. Most of the difficulty comes from the fact that you are _actually_ deploying only what looks like a single section of a limitless website. This has some consequences, which you should keep in mind, but are mostly circumventable. So, first things first...

## Who this section is (and isn't) for?

This section is mainly intended for those who have at least some experience developing web pages, or are willing to take necessary the time to acquire this experience. I assume you have some familiarity with the command line, with web development tools such as `npm` and `webpack` and with the combo HTML/JavaScript/CSS.

If you are looking for a Content Management System (CMS), such as WordPress, I am sorry to inform you that SAMIZDAT is still too young and nobody has taken the time to build one such system for it... yet! It's not a technology problem; it's a peoples problem.
